  abstract={The transit timing variations (TTVs) can be used as a diagnostic of gravitational interactions between planets in a multi-planet system. Many Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) exhibit significant TTVs, but KOI-142.01 stands out among them with an unrivaled ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 12 hr TTV amplitude. Here we report a thorough analysis of KOI-142.01's transits. We discover periodic transit duration variations (TDVs) of KOI-142.01 that are nearly in phase with the observed TTVs. We show that KOI-142.01's TTVs and TDVs uniquely detect a non-transiting companion with a mass ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 0.63 that of Jupiter (KOI-142c). KOI-142.01's mass inferred from the transit variations is consistent with the measured transit depth, suggesting a Neptune-class planet (KOI-142b). The orbital period ratio P c / P b = 2.03 indicates that the two planets are just wide of the 2:1 resonance. The present dynamics of this system, characterized here in detail, can be used to test various formation theories that have been proposed to explain the near-resonant pairs of exoplanets.}

  abstract={The timing variations of transits of an exoplanet provide means of detecting additional planets in the system. The short-period and resonant variations of the transit signal are probably the most diagnostic of the perturbing planet's mass and orbit. The method can be sensitive to small perturbing masses near the transiting planet and for orbits at mean motion resonances. It is not evident, however, how the mass and orbit of the perturbing planet can be determined from the observed variations of transit times. This is a difficult inverse problem. Direct N -body integrations are computationally too expensive to provide an adequate sampling of parameter space. Here we develop an alternative method based on analytic perturbation theory. We find that this new method is typically ~10 4 times faster than direct N -body integrations. The perturbation theory that we use here has an adequate precision to predict timing variations for most planetary orbits except those with very large eccentricities where the expansion of the disturbing function is divergent. By applying the perturbation method to the inverse problem we determine the number and precision of the measured transit times that are required for the unique and correct characterization of the perturbing planet. We find that the required precision is typically a small fraction (~15%-30%) of the full transit timing variation amplitude. Very high precision observations of transits will therefore be needed. We discuss the optimal observation strategy to characterize a planetary system from the transit timing variations. We find that the timing of secondary transits, if measured with adequate precision, can help to alleviate the problem with the degeneracy of solutions of the inverse problem.}
